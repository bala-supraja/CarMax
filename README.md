# CarMax Project
This project is a Python Colab notebook that presents an analysis conducted to provide marketing and inventory recommendations for CarMax's strategies aimed at optimizing operations for their new stores.

The data I am working with is from CarMax's 2024 Case Competition. Here is the link: https://github.com/kmx-analytics-showcase/Fall-2024/blob/64bea6dc5f535a7a92119f73b25e4a4a00a176cd/README.md

# Problem Statement
CarMax is considering opening new stores in the United States. How should marketing and inventory strategy be approached to drive maximum sales depending on the location of the new store?

# Data Set and Important Files
The data is composed of purchasers and non-purchasers and their shopping journey details, such as number of website visits, marketing touchpoints, geographic details, and vehicle purchase attributes. Vehicle purchasers bought a vehicle from CarMax; whereas non-purchasers did not purchase a vehicle with CarMax .

Disclaimer: This is pseudorandomly generated and manipulated CarMax data. No data corresponds directly to reality, but is inpired by and mimics true data. No data represents current CarMax inventory and business.
